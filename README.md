# Clicky

A project that utilizes Lua code and Roblox Studio to create a game that's fun for children. 

Currently in the works of exporting code to GitHub + getting model files. For now, I attached some images

## Ideaboard

Currently, this game is just about making a keyboard and different types of switches. 
Has different recordings of AKKO, Outemu, and AJAZZ 

Also has some "parkour" which is just to add for fun for when I release it on Roblox (because it's a kids game)
